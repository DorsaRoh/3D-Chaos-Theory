# Chaos-Theory
The computation of 3D chaotic dynamical systems.
Currently computes and graphs a Lorenz Attractor using the sigma, beta, Rho and time values given by the user. Includes trajectory curve graphs, XY axis matplotlib graph visuals, YZ axis matplotlib graph visuals, and XZ axis matplotlib graph visuals.
Additionally computes a Logistic Map using an inputted value for the r axis. Bifurcation can be controlled by the number of iterations.
